# Line Checklist

Before finalizing any change, verify:

[ ] Is this a line system, not a report-writing tool?
[ ] Can a normal case flow without human writing?
[ ] Is field input limited to taps / checks?
[ ] Is free text hidden by default?
[ ] Does approval store snapshot + hash?
[ ] Is AI used only for formatting or structured extraction?
