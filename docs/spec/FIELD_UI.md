# Field UI (3-minute input)

## Goal
Field input must be completed within 3 minutes without narrative writing.

## Required inputs
1) Arrival (one tap)
2) Start (one tap)
3) End (one tap)
4) Scope checklist (fixed template, multi-select)
5) Exception flags (select from predefined list)

## Forbidden inputs
- Free text narratives, evaluations, or proposals
- Guided chat or AI prompts

## Exception notes
- Only allowed when an exception flag is selected
- Short, constrained text (if enabled at all)

## UX rules
- Default view shows only the 3 taps, checklist, and exception flags.
- Free text is hidden by default.
- No AI guidance or suggestion prompts.
