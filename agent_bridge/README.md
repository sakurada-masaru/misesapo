# Collaboration Bridge

Purpose: smooth handoff between Antigravity, you, and Codex by making ownership and next actions explicit.

## Roles
- Antigravity: browser-based visual checks, quick UI feedback.
- You: decisions, priorities, final approvals.
- Codex: file edits, refactors, scripted changes.

## How to hand off
1) Update CURRENT_MISSION.md with the current owner.
2) Write the next concrete task and the exact file/path.
3) Add any logs/snippets to SCRATCHPAD.md.

## Conventions
- Use dates in YYYY-MM-DD.
- Keep tasks small and verifiable.
- Link to relevant URLs if a page must be checked.
