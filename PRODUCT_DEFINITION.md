# Product Definition: Report Line System

## What this product is
This product is NOT a report writing tool.
It is a line system where reports are generated automatically
as a byproduct of passing operational steps.

## Before (Current Problems)
- Heavy reports with photos, before/after, proposals
- Human narrative writing required
- Delays and high administrative cost
- Evidence intent is correct, but operation is broken

## After (Line System)
### Normal cases
- Field: arrival/start/end + scope checklist (<=3 min)
- QA: approve -> auto submit
- Finance: payment approval
- Output: Execution Certificate (company-issued, no evaluation)

### Exception cases
- Only flagged cases stop the line
- Limited photos, fixed proposal form
- QA gate required

## What is intentionally NOT included
- Narrative report writing
- AI judgement or evaluation
- Free-text proposals in normal cases
